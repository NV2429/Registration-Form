        <p>College is a crazy time. It's the intersection of <em><strong>life, money, education, career, and more.</strong></em><br>
          It's a time to learn, to figure out yourself, to be on your own, and to start to understand life.<br>
          With that in mind, it's essential to connect with like-minded people (even if only across the internet).<br>
          That's why I wanted to put together a list of the best blogs for college students. I wanted to share the best. <br>
          Those blogs that are covering things that actually will make a difference if you're in college, or even just thinking about it.</p><br>
